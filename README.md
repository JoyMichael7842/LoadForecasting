<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Load forecasting is really required for an electrical organization or a government body so they can buy the necessary shares in case of a heavy demand of power.  
Here's why:
* Basically saves a lot of time  
* Can know beforehand if there will be a power shortage 

Of course, even this is not 100% accurate.I tried to reduce the loss to a max of 5%
